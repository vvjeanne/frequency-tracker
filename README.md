# frequency-tracker
A C++ console application that tracks and analyzes grocery item purchase frequencies using file I/O and std::map, featuring item search, frequency reports, and histogram visualization.<br>
I have developed a C++ console application that reads grocery transaction data from a text file, tracks the frequency of each item purchased, and provides users with multiple interactive reporting options. The program supports searching for specific item frequencies, displaying all purchase data, and visualizing results with an ASCII-based histogram.
